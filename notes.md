# Password Generator
### Description: A password generator app with user-specified settings and copy-to-clipboard functionality.

1. **Input Controls:**
User-specified password length (e.g., slider or input box).
Toggle switches for including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

2. **Output:**
Generated password display with copy-to-clipboard functionality.
Regenerate button for generating a new password.


**Proposed Approach**

- Frontend Framework: Use React for its modular structure and easy state management.
- Styling: Use Tailwind CSS for efficient, responsive styling.
- Logic Implementation: Implement the password generation logic with JavaScript inside React components.
- Additional Features:
    - Add clipboard API for the copy-to-clipboard function.
    - Add feedback (e.g., “Copied!” notification) using React’s state.
    - Optional: Include a password strength meter using a simple scoring algorithm.


**Implementation**

- **Design Components:**
    - PasswordDisplay: Displays the generated password.
    - LengthSlider: Slider component for choosing password length.
    - SettingsPanel: Toggle switches for password settings (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).
    - GenerateButton: Button for triggering password generation.

- **Write Password Generation Logic:**
Create a function that accepts the character length and selected settings to generate the password using character sets.
Use ``Math.random()`` or ``crypto.getRandomValues()`` for better randomness.

- **Integrate Clipboard Functionality:**
Add a button with an ``onClick`` event to copy the password to the clipboard using ``navigator.clipboard.writeText()``.

- **Enhance User Experience:**
Show a confirmation message when copying the password.
Add animations for toggles and buttons.
